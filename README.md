# Gillespie-Algorithm-in-Python
A genetic algorithm written in Python3 designed to simulate one of two chemical systems.

System 1:
Simulates molecules A and B converting into molecules of type B  if they collide.
A+B -> B,k

System 2:
Simulates a chemical system with four possible reactions.

To run:
 - python3 gillespie.py
